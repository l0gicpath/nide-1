nide is an simple but powerful webIDE using the Nitrogen framework, EditArea and various JSquery plugins with the purpose to speed up Erlang/Nitrogen projects.

The feeling to working with nide is the same as any desktop IDE, if you are using browser with modern javascript engine, using chrome/v8 is my recommend.

Most of development of nide is done using early stages of nide itself :)

On repo you can found the typical tree of nitrogen project but the files you actually needed is:

./site/src/ide.erl
./site/static/css/ide.css
./site/static/js/*
./site/templates/ide.html
